\section{The institutional setting of legislative debate in the Cámara} [ca 1500 words]

This section offers an overview of the structure of legislative debate. The Cámara's Rules \citep{reglamentoDipMx.2019} set most prescriptions for debate, with general guidelines in Congress' Organic Law \citep{loceum.2019}.

%% Who controls the legislative agenda and allocates speaking time?
%% 1. Who can allocate speaking time to individual MPs? Who controls the legislative agenda – government, parties, MPs, some legislative structure specifically in charge with agenda-setting? In answering this question, you should aim to discuss both formal rules (constitutional rules, rules of procedure), party internal rules (if they exist), and informal rules.
%% - party leaders (junta selects), member (self-selects), president (duration), in that order of importance

Party leaders move the strings of lawmaking. Their influence, however, derives almost exclusively from party discipline (near-perfect across the board) and not from agenda power (which is quite diffuse). 

There are two key actors in the legislative process, the Junta and the Mesa. The *Junta de Coordinación Política* is the Cámara's top decicion-making organ. The leaders of all parties with no fewer than five deputies are represented. The leader of the majority presides the Junta throughout the term. In the absence of a majority party, however, the leaders of the top-three seatholding parties preside the Junta, alternating one year each. The Junta (also the Mesa) decides by majority rule, with members' votes weighted relative to group sizes in the plenary. So majority status is crucial to control the Junta and the legislative process \citep[cf.][]{cox.mccubbins.2005}. The *Mesa Directiva* is the chamber's steering board. The Mesa chair is the Cámara president ex-officio. The Mesa has consensual traits regardless of there being a majority party or not. It is elected yearly by two-thirds supermajority of Cámara members from candidates proposed by the Junta. While Mesa members can reelect, the chair must rotate between the top-three seatholding parties, one year each. 

% I use the terms party and parliamentary group interchangeably, but groups are in fact more restrictive. A group (/grupo parlamentario/) needs no fewer than five deputies to earn and retain Junta representation. Moreover, groups can only form at the term's outset. Members can freely leave one group and may join another existing group at any time, with immediate effects in vote weights. But defectors cannot form new groups---no doubt raising the cost of lone turncoats. 

The Junta prepares each session's order of the day (/orden del día/). But agenda control is frail. First, every committee report is guaranteed floor consideration and must be included in the order. If committees were adequate agents of the Junta majority, they might serve as gatekeepers by denying unwanted bills a report. But the Junta is required to distribute committee chairs (as well as committee membership) proportionally among the parties, so some committees are bound to be preference outliers.

Second, the open rule is the default for bill consideration in the floor. Debate takes place in two stages. The entire bill is first examined /en lo general/, then articles are considered individually for amendment or deletion /en lo particular/ \citep[see][]{heller.weldon.nd}. Members can always reserve articles for amendment, denying the Junta a useful prededural tool common in other assemblies: the closed rule \citep[eg.,][]{cox.2006,weingast.1992,diermeier.feddersen.1998,magar-palanza-sin-Pdt-fast-track-chile-2021jop}.

Third, and most relevant, speakers can self-select. Individual members are entitled to take the floor when recognized by the presiding officer, for a duration set by rules or by party agreements. Party leaders can allocate speaking time to a list of speakers but cannot preclude others from adding their names to that list, making debate resemble first-come-first-serve. 

%%Formally, deputies enjoy equal rights and duties. With respect to deliberation, all are entitled to take the floor when recognized by the presiding officer, for a duration set by rules or by party agreements. However, as in assemblies worldwide, members with status tend to have many more rights, the rest many more duties. What defines status changes from one assembly to the next \citep{cox.2006}. In the Cámara, party leaders in general, and majority party leaders in particular sit atop the status pyramid. But when it comes to speech, individual members retain debate rights that set the basis for minority rights. 

%% 5. What are the existing types of debates? Please select the 5 most important types of debates and produce a table where you cover the name of the debate (in English and the native language of the country), its goals, particular organization rules to that kind of debate, and the total number of minutes that rules assign to each debate.

\subsection{The structure of debate}
Rules set distinct limits on different kinds of debate. The Table offers a summary. The first entry refers to the drafter of new legislation, who can take the floor to persuade fellow lawmakers. The time limit is ten minutes for authors of new laws (), who get first recognition, five for authors of amendments to existing statutes. Diputados who wish to speak in reponse then get five minutes each. When the bill cannot be presented before the end of the session, the author can request /viva voce/ its migration to the next day's order (otherwise it is referred to committee.) The table also states who selects the designated speaker, self-selection by the drafter in this case. The final column describes if someone has power to veto the speaker's recognition---no one here.

\caption{Types of debate}
\end{table}

Other speech types grant right of first recognition differently. Debate /en lo general/ grants it to the reporting committee chairperson for ten minutes (fifteen in constitutional amendments). The Cámara president can delay debate by recommiting the bill---and possibly prevent it, while killing the bill, with help from the committee. /En lo particular/ amendments and Cámara resolutions grant it to the proposing member. 

Party-appointed speakers get five minutes each, in reverse-size order, after the first /en lo general/ speech. Then members who request it get five miutes each, the president arranging them in rounds, one for one against. After six rounds of speakers, the floor can proceed to vote, or continue with three more rounds of speakers. And so on until no more speakers request it or the floor decides to vote.

%Floor (108) must approve member requests to consider an article separately from general discussion (deletion amendment?)

%Votos en lo particular = another window for dissenters. Minority report. Minority reports get floor consideration only when floor rejects the committee report. 

%Discusión en lo particular = introduce amendments to committee report (who can do it? who can block? 110 silence suggests that any member can do it --- open rule unless rules are suspended?) Proposer gets 5 minute speech, then for/againsts get 5 minute each.

Cámara resolutions (/proposiciones con punto de acuerdo/) are taylor-made for members' position-taking needs, conditional on party leader support. If adopted, resolutions become the opinion of the chamber on some specific issue. But they require urgent status (/urgente u obvia resolución/) in order to avoid committee referral and move directly to the floor; only the Junta can request that the floor grants urgent status to at most two resolutions during the session. If granted, the proposer takes the floor for five minutes. Parties then appoint one speaker each, for three minutes. The floor can then decide to vote, or open a new round of debate. Current events are party leaders' position-taking venue. The Junta determines up to two themes for debate before bill consideration, and party leaders appoint one speaker each. The promoting party speaker takes the floor 10 minutes, others 5 minutes each, and intervene in reverse-size order. Current events debate cannot exceed two hours in the session. 

%3. How is the debate structured? What are the rules of engagement? Do MPs engage in back-and-forth talk? By contrast, do MPs deliver a debate without interruptions?
%- Back-and-forth talk is very rare, rules make for a sequence of short speeches. Once recognized, a member can speak for a limited time (extendable with President's assent). The speechmaker decides if interrupting her is kosher. 

Debate under such rules turns into a series of punctuated, mostly uninterrupted short speeches. Members can approximate back-and-forth talk, at least occasionally, by catching the president's eye from their seats in order to interrupt with a motion. The president can deny or grant up to three minutes to elaborate. Such motions are distinct from points of order (which members can also make, see Reglamento art. 114 for the typification of motions available). One is questioning (/cuestionamiento al orador/) to interrogate the speaker---who must also accept the motion. Another is right of reply (/alusiones personales/) to recognize alluded members rigth after the speaker ends; and fact corrections (/rectificación de hechos/) to wind up an additional speaker at the end of the list.

3. Why no chaos? Alternative to centralized agenda power is party discipline. 
4. Minority rights


Arg here:
While parties sit atop the status pyramid, their agenda power is relatively limited. 
Two problems: can't easily prevent unwanted speeches as members retain right to talk; can't easily remove unwanted motions as committee reports proceed automatically to floor discussion. So negative agenda power is diffuse. 
Parties in fact rely on discipline towards leadership to avoid plenary bottlenecks and get legislation done.
